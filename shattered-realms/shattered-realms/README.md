## The World

### The Cataclysm

A thousand years ago, a war between archmages nearly destroyed the world. Their final battle tore reality itself, creating the **Shattered Rifts** - permanent tears in the fabric of space that leak wild magic and connect to other planes. The land was broken into isolated regions, and civilization collapsed.

### The Present Day

The world is slowly recovering. New kingdoms have risen, but the rifts remain, spawning monsters and warping the landscape. Adventurers are needed to explore ancient ruins, close dangerous rifts, and protect the fragile peace between the races.

### Major Regions

- **The Fractured Kingdoms** - Human territories struggling to unite
- **Ironpeak Mountains** - Dwarven holds and orc strongholds in conflict
- **The Twilight Forest** - Elven lands corrupted by rift magic
- **The Ashen Wastes** - Desolate lands twisted by planar energy
- **Rift City** - A multicultural hub built around a stabilized rift

## Campaign Structure

The module supports multiple play styles:

### Sandbox Exploration
