# Game Master's Guide - The Shattered Realms

## Running the Campaign

### Campaign Themes
- **Hope vs Despair**: The world is recovering, but constant threats from rifts test people's resolve
- **Unity vs Division**: Different races must work together against greater threats, but old hatreds persist
- **Order vs Chaos**: The rifts represent raw chaos; civilization struggles to maintain order
- **Redemption**: Characters like Grommak and the Shadowfang Clan show that change is possible

### Campaign Structure

**Option 1: Linear Story Arc (Levels 1-10)**
Follow the main quest line:
1. The Broken Tower (1-3)
2. Shadows of Ironpeak (3-5)
3. The Twilight Curse (5-7)
4. Rift Runners (7-9)
5. The Final Convergence (9-10+)

**Option 2: Sandbox Exploration**
Let players explore freely, using:
- Random encounter tables
- Location-based adventures
- Faction missions
- Rift investigation quests

**Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**
Mix sandbox elements with the main plot, allowing side quests and exploration between major story beats.

### Session Zero Recommendations
